# Quix Navbar Starter
 Starter project and requirements for Navbar assignment

## Requirements:
1.	Use the project we started in class (CSS Part 5 – Navbar - This should be a  perfect copy) 
2.	Add another list item to the navbar. Something like “FAQ” is fine.
3.	Navbar items must use a Google Font, add one of your choosing
4.	Remove the underline from hyperlinks, and change the text color to one of your choosing other than blue
5.	Make the navbar permanently stay at the top of the page, even if you scroll down. To test this add a <p> with “ipsum lorem” text, or nonsense text to fill up space and act as a content placeholder. To automatically generate ipsum lorem text fast, use the “lorem” command in VS Code, or go to https://loremipsum.io/ 

6. BONUS (+10 pts): Add HTML pages for each of your navbar links, and use the same CSS file to style all of your pages. Make sure the navbar navigates to each page, and that each one has its own working navbar that matches the one you've created on your Home page


# How to submit your assignment (Refresher):
In order to publish your assignment, go to the SOURCE CONTROL tab in your left sidebar within VS CODE. You may need to click the elipses (...) in order to find the tab. 

You will then click on the SOURCE CONTROL dropdown, and then hit the blue COMMIT button. You will be asked if you would like to stage your changes, click YES.

You will be brought to another screen asking for a commit message. This is required by GIT. Enter a message, such as "first update" or "fixed bug with HTML", etc. Once you've entered your commit message, click the checkmark in the top right of VS CODE next to the "play" button to enter your commit message and stage your commit.

## *AFTERWARDS, DON'T FORGET TO THEN CLICK THE BLUE SYNC BUTTON IN THE PLACE WHERE THE "COMMIT" BUTTON WAS BEFORE TO ACTUALLY PUSH YOUR CHANGES TO GITHUB*
