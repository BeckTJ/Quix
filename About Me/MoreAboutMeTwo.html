            <h1 class="uppercase"><u>About Me</u>:</h1>
            <p>Currently, I am a distillation operator with EMD Electronics. I have been working with this company
                for 4 years. For the last year and a half I have been teaching my self to program. Mainly C# and T-SQL,
                however, Frontend is important so I have been learning React-Native. My Javascript skills are a bit
                lacking, which makes it
                difficult to use React.
            </p>
            <p>I enjoy programming because it requires constant learning and it keeps the mind engaged. I am working on
                a career switch and
                making programming what I do for a living. Hope that doesn't destroy the enjoyment. I have put a link to
                my github account, however it is rather empty. I haven't
                uploaded many files. It's on the todo list.

                        I update and refactor the program. It is a very slow process. Very worth it.</p>

            <p>I decided to take this class to improve my frontend skills. Focusing mostly on Javascript. I am also
                here to build connections, those that enjoy building, modifing, and going crazy trying to figure out how
                it all works.
