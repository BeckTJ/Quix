# ASSIGNMENT: “Car Factory”

## Create an SPA (single page app) that accepts inputs, creates new “car” objects, and puts that information on your DOM

**Requirements:**
1. Create **NEW** HTML, CSS, and JS documents, and link them. 
*Use the example files as a demo*
2. Your SPA must accept 3 input values from your HTML doc: Year, Make, Model
    *(i.e. – Year: 2003, Make: Ford, Model: Fiesta)*
3.	Your SPA must take these values from inputs, create a new object, and then post these values to your DOM. (see example -- to test it, go to **EXAMPLE_DOC.html** and begin a debug session) 

*You may add any styling, extra features, tests, error handling, etc. that you wish. Students who go above and beyond may even recieve additional bonus points!*

**BONUS (+10 pts): Make it so that new entries don’t override old ones!**

# How to submit your assignment (Refresher):
In order to publish your assignment, go to the SOURCE CONTROL tab in your left sidebar within VS CODE. You may need to click the elipses (...) in order to find the tab. 

You will then click on the SOURCE CONTROL dropdown, and then hit the blue COMMIT button. You will be asked if you would like to stage your changes, click YES.

You will be brought to another screen asking for a commit message. This is required by GIT. Enter a message, such as "first update" or "fixed bug with HTML", etc. Once you've entered your commit message, click the checkmark in the top right of VS CODE next to the "play" button to enter your commit message and stage your commit.

## *AFTERWARDS, DON'T FORGET TO THEN CLICK THE BLUE SYNC BUTTON IN THE PLACE WHERE THE "COMMIT" BUTTON WAS BEFORE TO ACTUALLY PUSH YOUR CHANGES TO GITHUB*
