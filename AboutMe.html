      <h2>About Me:</h2>
      <p>Currently, I am a distillation operator with EMD Electronics. I have been working with this company
        for 4 years. For the last year and a half I have been teaching my self to program. Mainly C# and T-SQL,
        however, Frontend is important so I have been learning React-Native. My Javascript skills are a bit lacking, which makes it 
        difficult to use React. 
      </p>
        <p>I enjoy programming because it requires constant learning and it keeps the mind engaged. I am working on a career switch and 
          making programming what I do for a living. Hope that doesn't destroy the enjoyment. I have put a link to my github account, however it is rather empty. I haven't 
          uploaded many files. It's on the todo list.

      <h2>Hobbies:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Fixing Cars</li>
        <p>Specifically my Jeep. Need to get it offroad ready.</p>
        <li>Video Games</li>
        <p>GamerTag: Lost1nTim3</p>
        <p>Overwatch, Destiny & Borderlands to name a few. Not a big fan of Battleroyals, mainly because I
        don't live long enough and sit in queue more then actual game time. These days your more likly to find my daughter on my account.</p>
        <li>Programming</li>
        <p>When i have free time I work on a program that I am building to solve a problem at work. As I learn
        I update and refactor the program. It is a very slow process. Very worth it.</p>
      </ul>
  </div>
    <div class="reasons">
      <h2>Reason For Taking This Class:</h2>
      <p>I decided to take this class to improve my frontend skills. Focusing mostly on Javascript. I am also
      here to build connections, those that enjoy building, modifing, and going crazy trying to figure out how it all works.
